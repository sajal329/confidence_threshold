# Confidence Threshold in Self-Training

This repository explores the use of confidence thresholding in self-training to improve model performance in semi-supervised learning.

## About the Project

This tutorial introduces confidence thresholding as a method to refine pseudo-labels during self-training. By filtering out low-confidence predictions, the process ensures better quality labels for retraining the model.
